In C programming, both structures (struct) and unions (union) are user-defined data types that allow grouping of different data types under a single name. They differ primarily in how they manage memory and store their members.

Structures (struct)

    - A struct is a collection of variables (members) of different data types, grouped together under a single name. Each member within a structure occupies its own distinct memory location. This means that all members of a structure can store values simultaneously and independently.

    syntax:

        struct sturcture_name {
            data1,
            data2,
        }s1, s2

        struct sturcture_name s1, s2


Unions (union)
    A union is also a collection of variables (members) of different data types, but unlike structures, all members of a union share the same memory location. The size of a union is determined by the size of its largest member. At any given time, only one member of a union can hold a meaningful value; storing a value in one member will overwrite the value of any other member. 

    syntax:

        union union_name {
            data1,
            data2,
        }s1, s2

        union union_name s1, s2
