In C programming, loops are control structures that enable the repeated execution of a block of code until a specified condition is met. This mechanism is crucial for handling repetitive tasks efficiently, avoiding redundant code, and automating processes.

C offers three primary types of loops:

1] for loop:
- The for loop is ideal when the number of iterations is known in advance.
- It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement, all within the loop's declaration.

Syntax:

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to be executed
}

Eaxmple: 

for(int x = 1; x >= 1; x++){

}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2] while loop:
- The while loop executes a block of code as long as a given condition remains true.
- The condition is checked before each iteration. If the condition is initially false, the loop body will not execute even once.

Syntax:

while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3] do...while loop:
- Similar to the while loop, but with a key difference: the do...while loop guarantees that the loop body will execute at least once.
- The condition is checked after the first iteration.

Syntax:

do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);

---------------------------------------------------------------
The goto statement in C is a control flow statement that facilitates an unconditional jump to a labeled statement within the same function.

syntax :

goto label;
// ... (code that might be skipped)
label: statement;



Key Benefits of Using Loops:
    - Efficiency: Automate repetitive tasks without writing the same code multiple times.
    - Conciseness: Reduce code length and improve readability.
    - Flexibility: Adapt program behavior based on runtime conditions or user input.
    - Data Processing: Effectively iterate through data structures like arrays.
