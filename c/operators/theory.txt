Operators in C are special symbols that instruct the compiler to perform specific mathematical, logical, or relational operations on operands (variables or values). They are fundamental to C programming, enabling computation, comparison, and manipulation of data.

Types of Operators in c

Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical calculations.
Assignment Operators: Assign values to variables.
Relational Operators: Used for comparing two values, returning a boolean result (true or false).
Logical Operators: Combine or modify conditional expressions.
Conditional Operator (Ternary Operator): A shorthand for if-else statements.
Other Operators:
Bitwise Operators: Perform operations on individual bits of integer data.
