A variable is a named memory location used to store data in a C program.

➡ A variable is like a container that holds a value, and the value can change while the program runs.

syntax : datatype variable_name = value;


Why are variables needed?

We use variables to:
    - store data
    - perform operations
    - change values during runtime
