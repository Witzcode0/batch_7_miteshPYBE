Imagine you have a box where you put a number and you lock the box 🔒.
Nobody can change the number inside the box.
That locked number = constant.

A constant in C is a value that cannot be changed during the execution of a program.
Once a constant is defined, it remains fixed.


#include <stdio.h>

#define PI 3.14   // symbolic constant

int main() {
    const int age = 20;   // variable constant

    printf("PI = %f\n", PI);
    printf("Age = %d\n", age);

    return 0;
}
