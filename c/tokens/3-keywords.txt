Keywords are "special reserved words" in C that have a fixed "meaning" and "purpose" in the language.

- You cannot use them as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.)

These words are already defined by the C compiler.

Important Points About Keywords

    - Fixed meaning
    - Cannot be changed
    - Cannot be used as variable names
    - All keywords are written in lowercase
