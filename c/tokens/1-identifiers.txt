An identifier is the name given to variables, functions, arrays, structures, constants, etc

Rules of Identifiers: 


✔ 1. Only letters, digits, and underscores are allowed

Allowed characters: A–Z, a–z, 0–9, _ (underscore)

❌ No spaces
❌ No special symbols like @, #, $, %, &, *

✔ 2. Identifier must NOT start with a digit

Example: 1level, level1

✔ 3. Identifiers are case-sensitive

Example : firstname, FirstName, firstName, FIRSTNAME

✔ 4. No keywords allowed

Example: for, if, else, while

✔ 5. Length limit

C standard doesn’t fix a strict length, but compilers typically:
- recognize at least first 31 characters (for variables)
- recognize first 63 characters (for functions)
- Better to keep identifiers short and meaningful.

✔ 6. Should be meaningful (recommended best practice)

Not a rule but a good habit:

Example : int studentCount;

✔ 7. it must be unique
