An array in C is a collection of data items of the same data type. stored in contiguous memory locations and accessed using a single name and an index. Arrays are fundamental data structures in C for managing multiple related values efficiently.


Key Characteristics of Arrays in C:
Homogeneous Data Type: All elements within an array must be of the same data type (e.g., all integers, all characters, all floats).
Contiguous Memory Allocation: Array elements are stored sequentially in memory, meaning they occupy adjacent memory addresses.
Fixed Size: Once declared, the size of a static array in C cannot be changed during program execution. For dynamic resizing, dynamic memory allocation functions like malloc() and realloc() are used.
Indexed Access: Individual elements are accessed using an index, which is a non-negative integer representing the element's position within the array. C arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.

1d:

data_type array_name[size] = {
    val1, val2,....valn
};
data_type array_name[size] = "brijesh";

mD:

data_type array_name[row][col] = {
    {
        val1, val1, val1
    },
    {
        val2, val2, val2
    }
}
